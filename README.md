# Code Showcase 1

This repo is for displaying the things I have learned to code and concepts grasped for coding in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and using the framework Bootstrap. Each file will contain comments that explain the code I used and my think behind it.

### FizzBuzz

This simple snippet of code is designed to display the grasp of the operators, logic, and loop concepts. *Uses For, While, If, Else, and Modulos.* Also basic variable creation and management. 

**Desired output:** An output containing any number divisible by three printed as "Fizz", divisible by five printed as "Buzz", and if divisible by both printed as "FizzBuzz".

### Fibi

This small snippet displays an understanding of increments, indexes, and basic functions with parameters. *Uses function, parameters, list/array indexing, and increments.*

**Desired output:** An output returned from the function that contains a list/array with a series of Fibonacci numbers up to the count of the inputted parameter "n".

### Dicee

This game is launched in a browser to create a randomized dice roll between two "players". *Uses JS, CSS, Bootstrap5, methods and some DOM understanding.* I already had a good understanding of HTML and CSS.

**Desired output:** A rendered and interactive webpage that gives the ability to "roll" the dice, see the result displayed, and then notify the winner.

#### Markdown, Git CLI, and Github

This document also displays a basic understanding of Markdown. Additionally the repo was create on Github, but the versioning and remote push were all executed from the CMD line with Git.
